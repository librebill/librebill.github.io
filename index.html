                Our mission is to build a billing platform that is extendable, themable and API-centric so it can be used by anyone. From freelancers that bill by the hour to cloud providers that hate being hostaged by the price increases of their billing platform &mdash; we got you. 
            </p>
            <p class="description mt-2">
                LibreBill is under active development and is sponsored by <a href="https://dual.ph" target="_blank">Dual</a>, a software development and cloud consulting firm based in Manila. We are a team of engineers that hated the vendor lock-in of leading solutions and decided to build a solution that works for everyone.
            </p>
            <p class="description mt-2">
                LibreBill is being built with Laravel and Vue and is planned to be released under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">GNU General Public License v3.0</a>.
